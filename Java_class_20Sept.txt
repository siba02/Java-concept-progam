Literals
=========

int x = 10;

keyword in java
data type

variable
identifier

10

constant/literals. 

int y = 125;


There are 5 types of Literals in java. 

Integral Literals. 
Floating point literals. 
Char literals. 
boolean literals. 
String literals. 



Integral Literals:
-------------------

Decimal form (base 10)

 0 to 9

int x = 10;
int y = 510;


Octal Form (base 8)

 0 to 7

 starting from 0 (zero)

int x = 0125; (valid)    
int x = 0786; 

Hexadecimal Form (base 16)

0 to 9  and A to F or a to f

starting from 0x  or 0X;

int x = 0x123;
int x = 0xFade;
int x = 0Xabcd;


binary form (base 2) (java 7 onwards)

0 and 1

starting from 0b or 0B;


int x = 0b123;

int x = 0b1010;

int x = 12345;


Floating point literals:
------------------------
float and double. 

any floating point value is by default data type is double. 

The literal with decimal points are called as floating point literals. 

double d = 10.5;
float f = 123.678;

double d = 0123.456;

floating point literals can't represented in different type of integral literal form like ocatal, hexadecimal and binary. 
Only integral form is allowed with floating point literal  as decimal form.


Char literals:
------------------

2 bytes

0 to 65535

char ch = 'a';  space;
char ch = 97;
char ch = '\u0061';
char ch = '\n';

boolean literals:
-----------------

boolean b = false;
boolean b = true;


String literals:
----------------
String s = new String("abc");

here  s is an object. 

"abcdsfdsfjsdkfhskdfkjsdhfksdjf\n"+
"sdkfjsdlkfjsdlfjsdlfjkslkj\n"+
"dfssfsfsf8766987767";


String s = "abc987&&**$$";
